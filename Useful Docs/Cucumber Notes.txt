Cucumber

Rules
1. Feature files created (Manual and Automation)
2. Step def should be created and implementation
3. Test Runner to execute the feature files

Maven Project (Simple)

src/main/java --> Supporting files that is needed to run your test cases (utilities, pages etc)
	stepDef
		Stepdef.java
			@Given("the application is launched successfully")
			public void launchapp() {
			.... code to launch the app
			}				
			.... similarly create for all the keywords
			


src/main/resources --> Dynamic content that is needed to support the files in src/main/java (locators env file, property files etc)

src/test/java --> Test cases that is going to be executed
	testRunner
		TestRunner.java
			
					
src/test/resources --> Dynamic content that is needed to support the files in src/test/java (Test data, feature files)
	features
		Login.feature
